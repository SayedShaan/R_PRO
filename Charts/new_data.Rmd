## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
ages =c(20,30,35,38,12,15,18,9,40,41,48,55,59,68,65,75,85,90)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(ages,
     xlim = c(0,100),
     col ="pink",
     border="black",
     breaks = 10,
   
     )



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
